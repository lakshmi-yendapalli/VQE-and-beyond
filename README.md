# Quantum Chemistry Simulations with VQE and Beyond
## Work in Progress
This repository contains materials for a tutorial on quantum chemistry simulations using Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA). Participants will learn to implement VQE, ADAPT-VQE, and noise-aware quantum simulations.

To install all the necessary dependencies for the tutorial's exercises, please refer to requirements.txt. Run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
